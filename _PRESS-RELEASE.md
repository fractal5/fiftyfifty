-- There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

-- For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

-- If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

-- If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

-- Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

-- Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
Simple Shared Expense Tracking

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
Easily split expenses with friends, roommates, or partners.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
Fifty-Fifty is a web app designed to easily track expenses that are shared across a group of people.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
When you share living or day-to-day expenses with other people in your life, it can be easy to forget who paid what. 

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
Take 30 seconds to record a transaction that you pay for, and at the end of the month, reconcile everyone's payments to figure out who owes who.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
"Keeping track of shared expenses can be an annoyance at best, and a major friction point among friends at worst. Fifty-Fifty aims to lower the friction, and make it a pain-free task."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
Set up an account in seconds, and start tracking your expenses right away.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
"My roommates and I used to have a painful meeting at the end of every month trying to tally up receipts to figure out who paid for what, and who needed to be reimbursed. Now, with Fifty-Fifty, we just check the app at month end and know the totals. An afternoon a month regained!"
