## Fifty-Fifty ##

When you share living or day-to-day expenses with other people in your life, it can be easy to forget who paid what. 

Fifty-Fifty is a web app designed to easily track expenses that are shared across a group of people, such as roommates or friends.

Record your transactions, and see how much each person has paid, via charts that give a bird's-eye view.
